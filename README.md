### Rails Lite

In this project, I implemented my own rendition of Ruby on Rails. The purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding of the inner-workings of Rails. Mainly the following:

- HTTP request-response cycle
- Rails' Rack Server
- Rails' ControllerBase class
- Cookies
- Custom Router
